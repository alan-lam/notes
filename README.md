# notes

Notes from (mainly) my math classes. Inspired by the "Build a Technical Documentation Page" project on freeCodeCamp.

It is a surprisingly effective way to review my notes after class. For my current one anyways. It probably could've been for my past classes.

Now if only I could type these math symbols faster.
